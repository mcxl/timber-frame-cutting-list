---

Until now there has been **no open-source, web-based takeoff canvas at all** — let alone one built for flooring. OpenTakeoff is that tool: a free, open-source alternative, given to the trade.

It started as the takeoff module of a private flooring estimating app, then got carved out, cleaned up, and released. **This is the real measuring engine, not a demo** — including **One-Click Area**, the flood-fill room tracer the $300/mo tools gate behind a subscription.

**Built for flooring, useful for any takeoff.** The measuring engine is general — area, linear, count, and deduct work on anything you'd scale off a plan (drywall, paint, concrete, sitework). What makes it *flooring's* tool is the finish-aware layer on top: conditions with CAD hatches, per-condition waste %, square-yard output, and a coverage-rate **materials buy list** nobody else hands the trade for free.

And there's nothing to set up. Open the page, drag in a plan, start measuring. Your PDFs and your takeoffs never leave your machine — there is no server in the loop.

## Quick start

You don't need to install anything to *use* it — just open the [**live demo**](https://opentakeoff.netlify.app), drag in a plan, and go.

To run it yourself:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

Drag **`demo/sample-plan.pdf`** onto the canvas. The scale auto-detects; pick a condition, hit **One-Click Area**, and click inside a room. Open **Report** to see the breakdown and export CSV / JSON.

## Features

### 1. Open anything, instantly
Drag in a plan **PDF**, an **image** (a scan or a screenshot), or a whole **`.zip` plan set** straight off a bid platform. Zips are unpacked and images wrapped to PDF *in your browser* — multi-page and multi-sheet, with up to **4 sheets side-by-side**. No upload step, no conversion service, no account.

### 2. A real measuring engine — not a counter with a ruler
**One-Click Area** is the headline: click inside a room and the linework bounds it, the polygon traces itself, and the vertices snap to true corners. It reads the drawing the way an estimator does — **hatching and poché don't fool it**: tile grids, plank lines, and section fills are classified as pattern, not wall, so a click inside a fully hatched room still traces the room (and a misread can never make the result worse than the strict fill — it escalates only when the strict pass comes back trapped). Plus the full manual kit — **Area, Rectangle, Linear, Surface-Area (walls), Count,** and **Deduct** (for columns, voids, and openings). This is the same engine pulled out of a commercial estimating app, not a toy reimplementation.

</div>

Manual tracing gets a real drafting aid: **45°/90° angle lock**. Come within a few degrees of square or diagonal and the segment you're drawing locks onto the axis — the click commits the locked point, so walls come out dead square (hold **⇧** to force the lock at any angle). On the canvas the crosshair **is** the cursor: the OS pointer hides, a star marks the crossing, and in-progress work draws in the instrument's own cobalt (committed shapes wear their condition color). The lock reads quietly — the star swells, the preview thickens, and a chip by the cursor shows the locked angle plus the **live segment length**. No extra chrome on your sheet.

### 3. Scale that matches real plan sets
Auto-detects the drawn scale note off the sheet, or **calibrate** from any known dimension (click two points, type the real length). Scale is remembered **per sheet** — because plan sets are never one uniform scale, and tools that assume they are get the numbers wrong.

### 4. Conditions that read like the drawing
A condition is one finish (LVP, carpet, tile, base, …). Each carries a **line/fill color** and a **CAD hatch pattern** (plank, herringbone, tile, terrazzo) so the canvas looks like the real drawing — plus a per-condition **waste %**, an **×N multiplier** for repeated identical units, a default **height** for wall traces, and a **thickness** that turns a linear run into border/feature-strip SF.

### 5. Assemblies — the supporting materials, done right
Per condition, list the consumables that actually go on the order: adhesive, sealer, polyurethane, thinset, grout, cove-base adhesive. Each has a **coverage rate** and a **basis** (floor SF / linear LF / each), and the order quantity derives automatically — measured ÷ coverage, **rounded up** to whole units. Adhesive lines get a **trowel picker** that fills the spread rate from the notch size. This is the layer most takeoff tools punt on. It's shipped here.

### 6. Reports & export
A per-condition breakdown — **Floor / Wall / Border SF, LF, EA, total SF, SY**, with and without waste — plus a combined **materials buy list**. Export to **CSV** or **JSON**, or print it. Waste is applied only in the report (the order quantity), never to the live measured number, so your takeoff and your buy list stay honest about which is which.

And when the numbers need to leave the app: **Marked Set PDF**. One click builds a distribution-ready PDF entirely in your browser — every sheet with the work burned in as drawn (condition colors, hatches, quantity chips, count markers, markups) behind a legend cover with the full totals and a by-sheet breakdown. Send it to a GC who will never install anything.

### 7. A vector-sharp canvas + plan-set tools
Zoom in and the linework stays **razor-sharp**: past ~1.15× the visible region re-renders straight from the PDF vectors at your current zoom — Bluebeam/AutoCAD-style — instead of magnifying a fixed bitmap, so fine callouts and hatching never blur. It overlays just what's on screen, so there's no giant full-sheet bitmap to hold. Plus a **dark view** (☾) that inverts the sheet itself — a true negative print, white linework on black, not a CSS filter — with hatches retuned so takeoffs read as well at night as they do at noon. And a visual **gallery** (`G`) to pick and open sheets, **Regroup** to restore a side-by-side composition in one click, per-sheet **Hi-Res** base rendering, **Snap** (beta) to plan lines and corners, and a separate **markup layer** (revision clouds, callouts, text notes) that's never counted in the totals.

### 8. Yours, locally
Every drawing, scale, condition, and markup autosaves to **your browser** (IndexedDB + localStorage). Nothing is uploaded, there's no account, and there's no server in the default build. Host the static build yourself and it stays exactly that way.

| **View** | Light or **dark (negative print)** — sheet pixels inverted at draw time, persists per browser |
| **Storage** | IndexedDB + localStorage — client-only, nothing uploaded |
| **Deploy** | One static build, hostable on Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3, or any static host |

## Run it / deploy it

**To use it, all you need is a browser.** To self-host, it's one static build you can drop anywhere — there's no backend, no database, no environment to stand up.

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build      # → web/dist/  (static; host it anywhere)
```

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/Kentucky-ai/opentakeoff)

The repo ships a root `netlify.toml`, so the button above is genuinely one-click. The same `web/dist/` works on **Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, S3** — anywhere that serves static files.

## Build on top of it

OpenTakeoff is **Apache-2.0**: fork it, change it, ship it — for your own crew or as the base of your own product. The codebase is deliberately small and readable so you can add the features *you* want:

- **Geometry & measurement** — [`web/src/lib/oneclick.ts`](web/src/lib/oneclick.ts), [`web/src/lib/sheets.ts`](web/src/lib/sheets.ts) (typed and tested)
- **Totals & materials math** — [`web/src/lib/totals.js`](web/src/lib/totals.js)
- **State & persistence** — [`web/src/lib/store.js`](web/src/lib/store.js)
- **UI** — [`web/src/pages/TakeoffCanvas.jsx`](web/src/pages/TakeoffCanvas.jsx) and [`web/src/components/`](web/src/components/)

Run `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build` before a PR; keep the geometry libs pure and tested; never commit real plans. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md).

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite, plain JSX
- **Drawing:** raw HTML5 Canvas + SVG (no charting/canvas frameworks)
- **Geometry:** TypeScript (`oneclick.ts`, `sheets.ts`)
- **PDF rendering:** [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js)
- **Plan-set ingest:** fflate (zip) + pdf-lib (image → PDF), lazy-loaded
- **Storage:** IndexedDB + localStorage — no backend required
- **Tests:** `node --test` + `tsx`
- **No paid dependencies.** See [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).

## Status

OpenTakeoff is a **working tool**, not a preview. The measuring engine — One-Click Area, conditions, assemblies, the report and exports — is the production engine carved out of a commercial flooring estimating app. **Snap** is marked beta. It's used on real commercial flooring bids; issues and pull requests are welcome.

## A note from the maker

I run estimating for a commercial flooring company. Every takeoff tool I've used costs four figures a year  — so I built the one I actually wanted, and I'm giving it to the trade.

This is the real measuring engine, not a teaser. **One-Click Area** is the same flood-fill room tracer the expensive tools gate behind a subscription. Open a plan, trace your rooms, hand off a clean report — free, and nothing ever leaves your computer.
